    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "OBSERVATIONS <br>\n",
    "1. Chater Schools outperform District Schools as is made clear by the difference in average math and reaading scores, as well as percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects concurrently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is evidence of a potential correlation between school size and passing grades. Medium-sized schools have consistently high numbers for percentage of students passing both subjects. Schools with a larger population have drastically lower scores in this area. While we don't have very many schools classified as \"Small\" in the data set, this analysis shows them to be somewhat in line with those of a \"Medium\" size. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The data suggests that both types of schools are shown to have more students passing reading over math. More analysis would be needed to delve further into why."
